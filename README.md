# Group 1 Problem - Stadium Seating
here are three seating categories at an athletic stadium.
For a baseball game, Class A seats cost $15 each, Class B seats cost $12 each, and Class C seats cost $9 each. 
Create an application that allows the user to enter the number of tickets sold for each class. 
The application should be able to display the amount of income generated from each class of ticketsales and the total revenue generated.
